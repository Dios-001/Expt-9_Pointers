# Pointer Examples in C++

This repository contains three C++ files that demonstrate basic pointer concepts:

## 1. basic_pointer.cpp

This program reads and prints the value of a pointer. It introduces the concept of pointer variables and how they reference and dereference data.

### Key Features:

- Declares a pointer to an integer.
- Reads and prints the value stored in the pointer and the memory address.

## 2. swap_value.cpp

This file implements a swap function using pointers. It shows how pointers can be used to modify the values of variables directly.

### Key Features:

- Implements a function `swap()` that takes two integer pointers.
- Swaps the values of two integers using pointer dereferencing.

## 3. increment_pointer.cpp

This program demonstrates how to increment an integer pointer. It highlights how pointers can be manipulated to traverse or increment data in memory.

### Key Features:

- Declares an integer pointer and increments its value.
- Shows the impact of pointer arithmetic.
